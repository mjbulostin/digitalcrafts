# 1. print out a list of engine choices (the whole list)
# 2. print out the horsepower values only (all of them)
# 3. check to see if the key "trim" exist on the car dictionary
# 4. add a new key to the car dictionary called "colors" which will be a list of all possible colors (use 4 color strings)
# 5. find an image and put the url into https://bitly.com/, and paste shortened url into that "image" value
